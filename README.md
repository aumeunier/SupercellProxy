## SupercellProxy

A proxy en/decrypting..
* ..Clash of Clans
* ..Clash Royale
* ..Boom Beach

traffic. Useful for private server, bot or API devs.
The proxy has its own Libsodium/NaCl port and manages to work without heavy external libs.

## Installation

The proxy installation takes ~5 minutes.
Info: This proxy only runs on Windows operating systems. Do not attempt to use mono, it won't work properly.
Open SupercellProxy.sln with Visual Studio and open App.config. Choose your preferred Supercell game by changing "host".
Run the proxy and wait until it finished loading. 
You need a modded APK file in order to capture and decrypt packets, visit our wiki and follow the instructions to mod an APK file.

* Bluestacks users:
Rightclick the modded APK > Open with > Bluestacks. DO NOT RUN THE MODDED GAME ONCE IT'S INSTALLED!
Mod the hosts file using Hosts Editor or a terminal application:

```
su
echo "insertyourlocalipaddress insertyourdesiredhost" > /etc/hosts
exit
```

Example:
```
su
echo "192.168.178.31 gamea.clashofclans.com" > /etc/hosts
exit
```
* Memu users:
Leftclick the +apk button on the right side bar and travel to the location of your apk. Download hosteditor from the Playstore and point the host of the game you have to your local IP or use the steps above for bluestacks.

```
Clash of Clans: gamea.clashofclans.com
Clash Royale: game.clashroyaleapp.com
Boom Beach: game.boombeachgame.com
Hayday: game.haydaygame.com
```

Open the modded game once you modded /etc/hosts and take a look at the proxy window.
You'll find the decrypted traffic at /SupercellProxy/bin/Debug/Packets.
Enjoy!

* Android smartphone/tablet users:
Tranfer the modded APK file to your device using adb or the file explorer and install it. 
I hope you enabled the "Trust unknown sources" option ;)!
Mod the hosts file, look at the steps under the Bluestacks section, there's no difference.
Run the modded game and you're good to go.
